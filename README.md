# Covid_California_Time_Series
Another project with my good friend Santiago, we just took some messy data sets off the CDC website and fixed them up in order for the data sets to be viable for time series. It wasn't pretty, but we got the job done. I also added some minimal EDA on counties that had their covid count suppressed, however, "suppressed" in this case meant that there was 0-10 people infected in the whole county at the time. Strange wording by the CDC, but at least you get to see which states had rural counties that weren't hit too hard by the pandemic. Source for data sets: CDC.

Edit: I also can't upload the second data set as the file is too big. You can probably search the file name as is written on the read.csv command though.
